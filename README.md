## Introduction
This is an EDA project on a dataset that contains various cars from different car makers. 
The dataset contains technical specifications of automobiles, insurance attributes, purchase prices, and many more variables. The dataset was compiled from data of 1985.
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on an Automobile dataset. The analysis aims to explore various aspects of the dataset, including data visualization, statistical summaries, and insights gained from the data.

## Dataset Overview

The Automobile dataset used for this analysis contains information about various automobiles, including their make, fuel type, aspiration, body style, horsepower, price, and more. The dataset provides valuable insights into the automotive industry and can be used for various analytical purposes.

## Analysis Contents

The EDA includes the following analyses and visualizations:

1. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, data formatting, and data type conversion.
2. Data Exploration: Exploring the distributions and relationships between different variables in the dataset.
3. Statistical Summaries: Calculating summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, etc., for numerical variables.
4. Data Visualization: Visualizing the data using various plots such as histograms, scatter plots, box plots, etc., to gain insights into the data.
5. Correlation Analysis: Analyzing the correlation between different variables to identify patterns and relationships.

## Tools Used

The analysis was performed using Python programming language and various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
   
## Requirements
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install seaborn
pip install matplotlib
```

## How to use

To reproduce the analysis or explore the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```git clone <https://github.com/fortune-ncube/automobile_eda/edit/main/README.md>```

2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
3. Open the  **automobile_eda.ipynb** Jupyter Notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Execute the code cells to run the analysis and visualize the results.
   
## Output

The notebook will generate compelling visualisations for decision-makers in various industries.





## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset file(s).
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks with the code for the analysis.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the analysis and repository contents.

## Conclusion

The EDA on the Automobile dataset provides valuable insights into the characteristics of different automobiles and their relationships with pricing. The analysis can be further extended or used as a basis for more advanced analyses or machine learning models related to the automotive industry.
